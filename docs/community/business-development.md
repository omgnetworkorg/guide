# Business Development

OmiseGO takes an integrated approach to community engagement and business development. 

> "True crypto projects build communities, not consumers."

It becomes difficult to separate community engagement from business development when simultaneously creating a completely free and open source product and an n-sided marketplace. Success depends on the health of a complex ecosystem of partners and collaborators, for a product that is equally aimed at enterprise providers and individuals operating entirely free of intermediaries.

Implementing this approach, **OmiseGO has done no paid marketing** (including bounties) and provided no discounts during its crowdsale to anyone, including VCs and media groups. **Nonetheless, the OmiseGO subreddit and Twitter account have the highest subscription rates of any Ethereum project so far.** 


### Official Statement

_The following is an official statement made by OmiseGO._

Although we still can't share a lot of details, we thought we'd at least include a sketch of our business development activities.

We're continuing to engage with projects large and small who are interested to build on OMG, and preparing to open up our internal testnet to a select few. We've been working on proofs of concept with a few of our larger enterprise users, and one of our partners has a plasma chain running in a test environment. We've been focusing on loyalty points as an entry point for enterprise eWallet users who are interested to move onto the blockchain but not ready to jump all the way in. Points are low-risk and don't have the regulatory complications that come with fiat or even cryptocurrencies, so it's a good way to test the waters.

We've also been developing partnerships with exchange venues (no, we can't tell you which ones) to bring volume and liquidity to the decentralized exchange. We're working closely with those groups to make sure that the DEX has the features that they need in order to leverage the network effectively.
